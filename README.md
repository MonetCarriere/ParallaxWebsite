# ParallaxWebsite
This is a parallax website I made.

 What I like about Parallax, is that it gives an effortless interaction where every time the user explores the website, their attention is 
grabbed by moving background images and text. 

As the user scrolls down the moon goes down with the scroll and the stars shift to the side which creates a cool story telling-like feel. 
It's done is such a way that it appears 3D. It gives such a cool visual appeal.
